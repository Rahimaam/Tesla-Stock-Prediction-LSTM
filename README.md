# Tesla-Stock-Prediction-LSTM
Description:

In this project, I undertook the exciting challenge of predicting Tesla's stock prices using historical data. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, I aimed to develop a model capable of providing insights into potential future price movements.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Collection and Preparation: Gathered historical stock price data for Tesla, ensuring data cleanliness and relevance.

Feature Engineering: Extracted meaningful features from the dataset to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Model Development: Employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to build a robust predictive model for Tesla's stock prices.

Training and Evaluation: Trained the model on historical data, fine-tuned parameters, and rigorously evaluated its performance against test datasets.

Skills Demonstrated:

Time Series Analysis: Utilized time series analysis techniques to understand patterns and trends in historical stock prices.

Machine Learning with LSTM: Implemented LSTM neural networks for their ability to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in sequential data.

Data Visualization: Created visualizations to communicate insights and model predictions effectively.

Model Evaluation: Employed metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to rigorously assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictive model.

Results:

The developed model demonstrated promising predictive capabilities, providing valuable insights into potential future stock price movements for Tesla.

Looking Forward:

Excited about the intersection of finance and data science, I am keen to further explore opportunities where my skills in stock price prediction and data analysis can contribute to informed decision-making processes.
